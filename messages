Node messages:

an initiator node will start an election:
ELECTION <node id> <next node id> <node id>
arg1: id of current node
arg2: id of next hop
arg3: id of current highest node

all nodes will drop or pass election messages:
if highest id < current node id, drop message
if highest id == current node id, send leader message
if highest id > current node id, forward message
ELECTION <node id> <next node id> <highest id>

if a node receives its own election message back:
LEADER <node id> <next node id> <node id>
arg1: id of current node
arg2: id of next hop
arg3: id of current node (highest node)

other nodes will drop or pass leader messages:
if leader id < current node id, something is wonky, drop message
if leader id == current node id, election was successful, go to working
if leader id > current node id, forward message
LEADER <node id> <next node id> <leader id>
